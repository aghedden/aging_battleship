# aging_battleship
Analysis code for project examining how aging impacts feedback-based learning from information and reward.

## About the project
This project began as an Honors Thesis at the University of Chicago, where I majored in Neuroscience and Psychology with Honors and graduated *magna cum laude* in 2023. 

Here, we aimed to understand how the ability to learn from informative and rewarding feedback changed across the lifespan.
