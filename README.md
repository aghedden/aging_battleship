# aging_battleship
Analysis code for project examining how aging impacts feedback-based learning from information and reward.

## About the project
This project began as an Honors Thesis at the University of Chicago, where I majored in Neuroscience and Psychology with Honors and graduated *magna cum laude* in 2023. 

Here, we aimed to understand how the ability to learn from informative and rewarding feedback changed across the lifespan. 

I received the following grants/awards to support this project:
- Quad Faculty Research Grant, awarded to connect faculty with talented College students to support their research projects and to develop their research skills
- Earl R. Franklin Research Fellowship, a highly competitive fellowship given by the University of Chicago Psychology Department to support rising fourth-year studentsâ€™ summer research based on a research proposal, personal statement, transcript, and letters of recommendation; awarded to three students in 2022 
- Jeff Metcalf Odyssey Fellowship Grant (5 separate awards), awarded to support unpaid research and internships conducted during the academic year
